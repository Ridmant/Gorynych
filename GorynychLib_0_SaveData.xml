                    <N K="Vind are small, relatively docile rodentoids that have become ubiquitous on Nexus. They were one of the first types of &quot;critters&quot; to be exported from the planet (albeit illegally, as Dominion law requires all life forms native to Nexus to be the property of the emperor) and are now a somewhat common site among the elite and wealthy of the Fringe underworld. Their planet-wide distribution on Nexus is almost certainly due to their ability to float by expanding internal gas organs that make them lighter than air. This ability to metabolize elements and synthesize exotic gasses has also made them prized by scientists, and not always for ethical reasons. " T="s" V="Винды (Vind) - маленькие, довольно послушные грызунообразные, которые встречаются на Нексусе повсюду.

Распространённость виндов по всей планете, скорее всего, обусловлена их способностью парить, увеличивая объём воздуха в теле, что придаёт им невероятную лёгкость. Способность усваивать элементы и синтезировать иноземные газы также сделала их ценными для ученых, и не всегда по этическим причинам. "/>

Many had died in service to their fellow Exiles in the ongoing conflict with the Dominion, while others fell victim to dangerous, less glamorous work on the aging ships of the Exile Fleet. \n\nHis mother died in childbirth, and a few days after Aron&apos;s fifth birthday, his father was killed when the hull of a starship unexpectedly ruptured. This left young Aron, the last Brightland, an only child - and one who had to raise himself, getting by as a vermin hunter on the older ships and becoming famous for his &quot;deadeye&quot; aim. During this time, Aron befriended one of the half-wild mutts that ran free in many of the aging starships of the Fleet and named him Grim.\n\nHaving survived on his hunting skills to reach adulthood, perhaps it was only natural Deadeye Brightland would seek to tackle more dangerous prey as a bounty hunter when he came of age. Bounty hunters were tolerated as a necessary evil on a Fleet where the lawmen were few and far between, and in no time at all he earned a reputation as a deadly gunslinger that always got his man.\n\nBut after a fight with the Marauder Captain Thokov cost him an eye (and gave him the nickname &quot;Deadeye&quot; for good),  he opted to leave the scarred, milky ruin &quot;as a reminder not to be so damned stupid next time&quot; and swore he would never again attempt to bring in a target alive.  He became feared by the criminal underworld, while tales of his deadly deeds spread throughout the Exile Fleet and beyond to the greater galaxy.\n\nRumor has it that Deadeye Brightland has recently decided to hang up his guns and make a new life for himself - and his new wife Sadie - on the planet Nexus." T="s" V="Хотя Брайтлэнд Одноглазый является прямым потомком героя Изгнанников – Сэррика Брайтлэнда (Serrick Brightland), командира, который возглавил восстание против Доминиона, ко времени его рождения линия знаменитой семьи угасла. Многие погибли, помогая собратьям Изгнанникам в непрестанных стычках с Доминионом, другие бесславно умирали, выполняя опасные работы на ветшающих кораблях флота Изгнанников.\n\nМать умерла от родов, а вскоре после пятого дня рождения Арона его отец погиб, когда корпус космического корабля был неожиданно пробит. Так и остался юный Арон, последний из Брайтлэндов, один. Ему пришлось воспитывать себя самому. Он стал свирепым охотником и прославился точностью прицеливания. В это время Арон нашел себе друга – одну из полуодичавших собак, которые бродят по ветшающим кораблям флота, и дал ей кличку – Грим (Grim).\n\nОхотничьи навыки помогли ему выжить, и ничуть неудивительно, что, достигнув совершеннолетия, Брайтлэнд Одноглазый стал охотиться за более опасной дичью – людьми. На флоте, где не было никаких законов, охотники за головами воспринимались как необходимое зло, и он скоро заработал репутацию смертоносного бандита(gunslinger), который всегда настигает жертву. \n\n Драка с капитаном Мародеров Токовым (Marauder Captain Thokov) стоила ему глаза (из-за этого к нему навсегда пристало прозвище «Одноглазый»), но Брайтлэнд решил не удалять его полностью. Молочно-белый глаз служит ему напоминанием &quot;не быть таким идиотом в следующий раз&quot;.Он поклялся, что никогда больше не попытается доставить жертву живой. Преступный мир начал его бояться – слухи о его деяниях разнеслись по всему флоту Изгнанников и за пределами галактики.\n\nПрошел слух, что Брайтлэнд Одноглазый недавно решил «засунуть пистолет в кобуру» и начать новую жизнь с женой Сади на планете Нексус."/>

Of the planet&apos;s two moons, the broken moon of Halon - which rests amid the rubble of a great catastrophe that saw the creation of the so-called Halon Ring in orbit around Nexus - is home to many unique Eldan ruins of interest to scientists and treasure hunters, while mysterious Pyra remains largely unexplored. The Halon Ring is home to criminals, space pirates, and vagabonds who have come to Nexus for quick and bloody riches. \n\n On the planet&apos;s surface, many areas have been settled by either the Dominion or the Exiles, though many other regions are still hotly contested. The importance of Nexus to galactic civilization cannot be overstated. Although very little was known about the Eldan themselves, the existence of their advanced Mechari servants and the creation of the Luminai resulted in endless speculation about what might be located on their homeworld. Long sought by adventurers, explorers, archaeologists and treasure hunters, the planet&apos;s location remained elusive for more than two thousand years - until it was discovered by the famous Exile explorer Dorian Walker.

It is rarely seen in its pure colorless form, however, for even a trace imbalance in the primal components of the mineral gives it a vibrant color indicative of the form of primal power that is dominant.

The integral seals on cryo-pods, therefore, are similarly tested and have long been considered so reliable that they could also be used as ship&apos;s escape pods (if equipped with basic heat-shielding) and instant quarantine units for victims of infectious diseases. Therefore, ever since corruption and the Strain were discovered on Nexus, one standard method of containment has been quickly placing anyone showing the first signs of symptoms into cryo-statis. In the case of Strain corruption, this is almost certainly a mistake. No infection vector like bio-phage and techno-phage has ever been seen in the galaxy before.
